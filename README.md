# Helton Da Graca

## Linux Systems | Infrastructure | Security-Minded Operations

Hi — I’m **Helton Da Graca**, an Active Duty U.S. Army Systems Maintainer (35T) transitioning into Linux systems administration and infrastructure-focused roles.

I bring 7 years of experience supporting mission-critical systems in secure environments, with a professional focus on reliability, access control, and operational discipline.

My work centers on developing deep Linux capability through hands-on engineering, scenario-based labs, and architecture-driven projects that mirror real-world enterprise patterns.

## Current Technical Focus

- Preparing for **Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)**
- Building production-style Linux lab environments  
- Practicing least-privilege access models and secure administrative workflows  
- Strengthening troubleshooting and system-level reasoning  
- Writing Bash utilities to validate and inspect system state
- RapidAscent Fellow focused on enterprise infrastructure skills  
- Preparing for CompTIA CySA+ to strengthen defensive security capability  


I prioritize understanding system behavior over memorizing commands and focus on building operational judgment that translates directly to production environments.
