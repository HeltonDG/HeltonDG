Hi, I’m Helton Da Graca 

Active Duty U.S. Army (E-5) | 35T – Systems Maintainer  
Aspiring Linux Systems Administrator / Engineer

---

### About Me

I’m a mission-driven systems maintainer with **7 years of Active Duty Army service**, including **4 years as a 35T (Systems Maintainer)** supporting and sustaining critical intelligence infrastructure in secure environments. I’m currently transitioning to the civilian sector and the National Guard, with a focused goal of moving into Linux systems administration and engineering roles.

My current emphasis is on **strong Linux fundamentals**, hands-on lab work, and building a deep understanding of how systems behave in production — not just how to configure them once.

### Current Focus

- Preparing for **Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)**
- Building RHCSA-aligned Linux labs (users, permissions, systemd, storage)
- Practicing least-privilege access models and secure operations
- Writing small Bash utilities to inspect and validate system state

I prefer learning by **building, breaking, validating, and documenting** rather than relying on rote memorization.
